Monday plan
	- 10-10:15am
		- QC Survey
	- Intro to MSA
	- 2pm: QC (Java/SQL)
	- After QC: Project time.

Scaling
	- Vertical Scaling
		- provide more power/resources to an application
	- Horizontal Scaling
		- provide more instances of an application

Microservice Architecture (MSA)
	- breaking down monolithic applications into smaller independent services
		- promoting decoupling
	- Monolith vs MSA
		- Monolith
			- System simplicity
			- More centralized control
			- Less Network Traffic
			- ACID transactions
		- MSA
			- More efficient resource allocation and scalability
				- scale a specific aspect of the application rather than the whole
			- modularity
				- decoupling
				- easy to upgrade/ replace
				- no longer tied to a particular tech stack
					- if all services are Restful, tech stack no longer matters
			- databases
				- MSA might have dbs for each of their services
					- multiple databases might need to be updated by a single request
					- lack of transactional operation (ACID)
						- Basic Availability, Softstate, eventual Consitency
							- BASE
			- Higher fault tolerance
				- if one instance goes down, does not break the whole application
			- Complex architecture
				- a lot more overhead
			- Chatty interfaces
				- a lot of interservice communication over a network

Spring Cloud
	- Spring project, designed to address "issues" related to MSA
		- provides implementation for design patterns solving these issues
			- Service Discovery/Registration
			- API Gateway
			- Circuit Breaking
			- Load Balancing
			- Central Config
