BootStrap
	- Library of classes that can be leveraged as premade templates
		- import bootstrap into HTML page
		- leverage classes to style elements
	- Responsive Web Design
		- websites and webpages that automatically adapt to different screen size/types
		- uses grid system to enable behavior

Mockito
	- Java Framework used alongside unit testing frameworks such as JUnit
	- Allows for mocking behavior
		- mocks objects to be used with Unit tests
			- ie: mocking dao layer so that database is not actually changed with every tests
	- @Mock
		- indicating to Mockito that a mock implementation is needed
	- @InjectMocks
		- specify an object that needs to have the mock implementation injected into it
			- replaces the actual implementation, ie: (EmployeePostgres)
	- when(mockObject.methodName(params)).thenReturn(returnValue);
	- @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
		- allows us to specify that we are running our unit tests with mockito

JavaScript
	- a scripting language that can be used for client-side web applications
		- can also be used server side
	- interpreted language
		- not a compiled language, no compilation step, interpreted by the browser
		- nowadays more modern browsers include JIT (just in time compilation)
	- supported by all modern web browsers
	- ECMA, manages the standard specification of JS
		- ECMAScript - standards
			- ES6, ES7... 
	- multi-paradigmed
		- mainly supports functional programming but can also mimick OOP
	- dynamically/weakly typed language
		- variables do not have to be declared with a specific type and can be changed dynamically
			- type coersion: 8 == '8' --> compares the value itself, return true
				- === to compare type and value
	- semi-colon injections
		- puts a semi-colon where it feels like it's appropriate implicitely.
			- can lead to issues
	- ways to include JS to an html page
		- internally, include between <script></script>
		- externally, <script src="path/to/file.js"></script>
			- best practice
	- Datatypes in JS
		- "primitives"
			- boolean
			- number
			- null
			- undefined
			- symbol -- we're not going to talk about symbol
			- string
		- "objects"
			- objects
				- stored as key-value pairs
				- similar to JSON
			- arrays
				- unlike Java, arrays are dynamically sized and can contain multiple datatypes
				- QC likes to ask about array methods
					- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
		- Truthy vs Falsy
			- any type in JS will valuate to either true or false
			- falsy values
				- null
				- underfined
				- 0
				- ''
				- false (the boolean)
				- NaN (not a number)
		- Functions
			- defined using the function keyword
				- function funcName(param1, param2){}
				- return a value, using the return keyword
			- additional types of functions
				- Function Expression/Anonymous Function
					- function declared without an explicit name, assigned to a variable instead
						- var someName = function (param1, param2){ return ...;}
				- SelfInvoking Function(IIFE, immediately invoked function expression)
					- function invoked immediately after definition
						- (function() {//code})();
				- Callback function
					- functions passed in as an argument
					- help with asynchronous programming
					- 
					function funcOne(x) {//something with x}
					function funcThree(x) {//something else with x}

					function funcTwo(y, callback){
						callback(y);
					}
					
					funcTwo(6, funcOne);
					funcTwo(6, funcThree);
		- JavaScript scopes
			- where a declared variable is accessible
			- global
				- variable declared outside of the function scope
				- accessible anywhere within the script
			- function
				- variables declared within a function block
			- block
				- variables declared with a {} block
				- new to ES6
					- introced let and const to declare variables
						- let can be reassigned but not redeclared
						- const cannot be reassigned nor redeclared
		- Hoisting
			- variables declared var will be hoisted to the top of their scope
				- top of global/function scope
				- functions get hoisted
			- used before they are declared

		- 'use strict'
			- defined that the code should be executed in strict mode
				- can't use undeclared variables
